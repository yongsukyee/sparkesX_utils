# SPARKESX Utilities

Description: Utility scripts for SPARKESX

The Single-dish PARKES for finding the uneXpected (SPARKESX) data sets is a compilation of real and simulated high-time resolution observations from the Parkes Murriyang radio telescope. For details on the dataset, see Yong et al. (2022, submitted).
SPARKESX is publicly available at CSIRO DAP: [Part 1](https://doi.org/10.25919/fd4f-0g20), [2](https://doi.org/10.25919/sqa9-rp38), [3](https://doi.org/10.25919/4g8p-gd74), [4](https://doi.org/10.25919/2jh1-3x70)

- `runalgo_template.py`: Template to run algorithm on SPARKESX
- `pypsrfits.py`: Read 1-bit PSRFITS file
- `evalsim.py`: Load SPARKESX labels
- `xcorrelation.py`: Code to compute cross-correlation across frequency
